# TickrTock

> ### Simple stopwatch app useful for tracking and recording work sessions on a project.

### Installation
```
npm install
```

TickrTock can help you keep track of the time spent on anything, such as a project for a client.

A `session` begins by starting the timer. You can pause and return to the `session` at a later time, (adding to the existing time) or the `session` can be saved and recorded, starting a new session.

Create as many sessions as you would like!

TickrTock can total your session times for you and generate a report, including total and average session times, among other details.

> ### TickrTock is created with Vue.js

TickrTock was primarily created for me to learn the Vue.js framework as an inspiring web developer, but if you find it useful, by all means fork it and experiment! :grin:
